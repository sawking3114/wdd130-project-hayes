                    <h3>First Wikis:</h3> 
                    Wikis began in 1995 when Ward Cunningham created WikiWikiWeb, the first website that allowed anyone to edit pages directly through their browser. His goal was to make a collaborative space where software developers could share ideas quickly without the barriers of traditional web publishing. As the concept spread, developers and early internet communities adopted the wiki model because of its simplicity, openness, and ability to grow organically. By the late 1990s, new wiki engines appeared, each adding features like page histories, user accounts, and improved navigation. In 2001, the launch of Wikipedia marked a major turning point, proving that a massive, volunteer-driven encyclopedia could be built using wiki technology. This era transformed wikis from small collaborative tools into a foundational part of the open-content movement.

                    <h3>Rise of Wikipedia:</h3>
                    From 2001 to 2005, wikis expanded rapidly in visibility and scale, largely driven by the explosive growth of Wikipedia. After its launch in 2001, Wikipedia quickly became one of the most active collaborative projects online, attracting thousands of volunteer editors from around the world. Its open-edit model proved surprisingly effective, leading to skyrocketing page counts and increasing public trust in community-curated knowledge. This success inspired many organizations and hobbyist groups to adopt wiki software for documentation, fan communities, and internal knowledge bases. During these years, new wiki engines and hosting services emerged, offering features like better version control, user permissions, and easier setup. By 2005, wikis had shifted from niche tools to mainstream platforms for collective information sharing, with Wikipedia serving as the most influential example of what large-scale collaboration could achieve.

                    <h3>Hosted Wikis:</h3>
                    From 2004 to 2010, wikis continued to grow in popularity, and hosted wiki platforms became a major way for online communities to organize information. During this period, Wikia—later known as Fandom—rose to prominence by offering free, easy-to-create wikis for fan groups, though its standardized layouts and increasing ad use sometimes frustrated long-time editors. Its centralized platform and built-in tools still made it convenient for communities that didn’t want to manage their own servers or install software. Other hosted services such as Wetpaint and early versions of Wikidot expanded at the same time, giving users different levels of customization and site design flexibility. As more people sought simple ways to start collaborative projects, hosted wikis became a popular option even if they sacrificed some control for convenience. By 2010, these platforms—Fandom included—had firmly established the hosted-wiki model as a common approach to building large, fan-driven knowledge bases.
